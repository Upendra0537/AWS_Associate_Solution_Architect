
Global infrastructure 
AWS Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches - for ease Content Delivery Network.
- Edge Locations get data from original server 
- Regional Edge Caches will have the data from Edge Locations.
- Edge Location - Point-of-presence
- First Invocation
	Web Server -> Edge Location -> Regional Edge Caches 
- Second Invocation
	Regional Edge Cache -> Edge Location -> Web Server


Placement Group
When two EC2 instances are requested, They would be selected with different Update Domain and Fault Tolerant in the same AZ

Elastic IP - static IP address - will not be charged if the EC2 instance is stopped

AMI - create an AMI with a Snapshot -> create a new AMI based on the old AMI.
If Old AMI Deleted no impact to the new AMI. And no impact to EC2 which is created with Old AMI. It is only that new EC2 instances with the old AMI cant be created

IAM
- user can be created to access the resources programatically or via console
- Users will have Access Key ID and Secret ID.
- Role = set of Policies for non physical users but for AWS services
- Policies - set of permission - ARN - Amazon Resource Name
